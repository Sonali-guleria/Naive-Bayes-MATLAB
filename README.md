# Naive-Bayes-MATLAB

This repository is an implementation of Naive Bayes to classify the data into two categories.The goal is to maximize posterior probability of x given it belongs to the category (i.e.) P(X|Y=yi) and hence deriving MAP estimates. It also uses the binomial distribution with prior Beta.
